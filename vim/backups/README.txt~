Assignment 2

NOTES
-----

The main program source is in regular_src, while the self-contained
extra credit implementation is in extra_credit_src. "java -version" reports
"java version 1.6.0_41" on my computer.

EXPLANATION
-----------

My solution to part 5 is to assign a single 'resource' semaphore to each atom.
This way, I can signal 4 to the Hydrogen semaphore and 1 to the Carbon semaphores
separately. Part 6 was accomplished by delegating the running on the chemical
bonding program to newly spawned atoms. This way, whenever a new atom is created,
it checks to see if a molecule can be made, and if so, triggers the chemical
bonding thread to run.


------------
EXTRA CREDIT
------------

For the extra credit (located in extra_credit_src), I allow arbitrary molecules to
be created in the following way:

    java Main <MoleculeName> <Atom1Number> <Atom1Name> <Atom2Number> <Atom2Name> ...

where MoleculeName and AtomXName are both strings with no spaces, and AtomXNumber
is an integer. For example,

    java Main Caffeine 8 Carbon 10 Hydrogen 4 Nitrogen 2 Oxygen
